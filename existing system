 Existing System  
Most of the existing operations in health clubs are manual now. No proper integrated ERP system is 
available for health clubs with complete control over asset management, member portal , chatbot, 
booking, attendance, forecast reports etc. Besides they don't have any control over their customer 
details. Most of the health clubs even don't have a systematic process flow. Some available features 
of existing software’s are listed below. 
 Gym software should also enforce key fee structures such as no-show penalties, late fees and costs 
for cancellations. An important component of existing management software is the ability to create 
contracts and waivers digitally. Paper documents are a thing of the past; digital documents help your 
gym to streamline signups and legal considerations. Management software should link seamlessly 
with your website and online presence. Online sales portal allows interested parties to fill application 
form anytime 24 hours a day, 7 days a week using Google doc’s .Performance tracking allows 
members to stay in touch with their goals and chart progress over time. Athletes can have immediate 
and continual access to their progress, from assessing past performance to anticipating future results. 
Optimal functionality in health club management software is key to running health club and its 
required operations successfully. It should offer a comprehensive solution for gym owners as well as 
the athletes and coaches who interact with it.
