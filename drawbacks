2.1.2 Drawbacks of Existing system  
No virtual help desk available in the existing system. If it has a virtual help desk customers 
will get round the clock support and marketing processes become more efficient and 
simple. No face recognition/biometric integrated automatic attendance management 
system is available in the current software.  
Virtual trainers are also not available in existing systems. Virtual training facility with a 
pre-trained chatbot might give 24/7 guidance to customers. Retention intelligence is not 
available for predicting fresh insights on how many gym members may be expected to 
leave a Health club at any given time.  
Auto guided customer registration is also not available, this might attract more users and 
make admissions easier. Facility for recurrent payment reminders and auto payment 
collection link generation and notification is not available in existing softwares
