 REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATIONS  
System analyst tasks to a variety of persons to gather details about the business process and 
their opinions of why things happen as they do and their ideas for changing the process. These 
can be done through questionnaires, details investigation, observation, collection of samples 
etc. As the details are collected, the analyst study the requirements data to identify the features 
the new system should have, including both the information the system produce and operational 
features such as processing controls, response times, and input output methods. 
Requirement specification simply means, “Figuring out what to make before you make it”. It 
determines what people need before you start developing a product for them. Requirement 
definition is the activity of translating the information gathered in to a document that defines a 
set of requirements. These should accurately reflect what consumer wants. It is an abstract 
description of the services that the system should provide and the constraints under the system 
must operate. This document must be written for that the end user and the stake holder can 
understand it. 
The notations used for requirements definition should be based on natural languages, forms 
and simple intuitive diagrams. The requirements fall into two categories: functional 
requirements and non-functional requirements. 
The requirements of specification of the proposed system are as follows: 
● Minimum time needed for various processing 
● Better service 
● Faster response time 
● User friendly
