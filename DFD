5.1.1 Data Flow Diagram  
A data flow diagram is a graphical technique that depicts information flow and transforms that are applied as data move from input to output. The DFD is used to represent increasing information flow and functional details. A level 0 DFD also called fundamental system model represents the entire software elements as a single bible with input and output indicated by incoming and outgoing arrows respectively.   
The DFD is one of the most important tools used by the system analyst. It can be used for the visualization of data processing. DFD provides a graphical representation of the flow of data through an information system. DFD illustrates how data is processed by a system in terms of inputs and outputs. It is a picture of system processing and flow without excessive concern for details.  
The DFD showing the top level of the system is called “Context Diagram”. It should be overview including basic inputs, processes and outputs. Then it is exploded in to more detailed lower level diagram that shows additional features of the system.  
The purpose of DFD is to provide a semantic bridge between users and system developers. The diagrams are graphical, eliminating thousands of words, logical representations, modeling what system does; hierarchical, showing system at any level of details; and Jargon less, allowing user interaction and reviewing.
