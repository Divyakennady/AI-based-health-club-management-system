 SYSTEM DESIGN  
 System design is a reduction of an entire system by studying the various operations performed and their relationships within the system and the requirements of its success. One aspect of design is defining the boundaries of the system and determining whether or not the candidate system should consider other related system. System can be defined, as an orderly grouping of interdependent components can be simple or complex.
The idea of the systems has been most practical and necessary in computerizing the interrelationships and integration of operations, especially when using computers. Thus it’s a way of thinking organizations and their problems. An organization consists of several interrelated and interlocking components.    
The most creative and challenging phase of the system life cycle is system design. The term design describes a final system and the process by which it is developed .It refers to the technical specifications that will be applied in implementing the candidate system .It also includes the construction of programs and program testing.    
The first step in the system design is to determine how the output is to be produced and in what format. Samples of the output and the inputs are also presented .In the second step, input data and master files are to be designed to meet requirement of the proposed output .The processing phase’s system’s objectives and complete documentation.    
 Finally details related to justification of the system and an estimate of the impact of the candidate system on the user and organization are documented and evaluated by management as a step towards implementation. The final report prior to the implementation phase includes procedure flow chart, record lay outs, and a workable plan for implementing the KDMS system.  
  
System design has two phases:   
 ❖ Logical 
❖ Physical   
 The logical design reviews the present physical system, prepares the input and output and also prepares a logical design walk- through .We have to deal with how to take entries required and whether and how to process the user data. Also we have to deal with how to present the data in an informative and appealing format .This design also involves the methodology to store, modify and retrieve data from the data base as per the requirement.   Physical design maps out the details of the physical system, plans the system implementation, devices a test and implementation plan and new hardware and software. We have to decide how and where to store the input data and how to process it so as to present it to the user in an easy, informative and attractive manner .A major step in the design is the preparation of input and output report in a form acceptable to the user .In this a data entry operator can feed the relevant details asked by the system for a particular task as input.
